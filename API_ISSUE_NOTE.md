# API Issue - Prediction Error

## Current Error
```
HTTP error: 500 - {"detail":"Prediction failed: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'tail'"}
```

## Problem Description
The API is encountering an internal error when trying to make predictions. The error suggests that somewhere in the prediction pipeline, the code is trying to call `.tail()` method on a numpy array, when it should be calling it on a pandas DataFrame.

## Root Cause
This typically happens when:
1. Data is converted from DataFrame to numpy array too early in the pipeline
2. A function expects a DataFrame but receives a numpy array instead
3. The data preprocessing step returns numpy array instead of keeping it as DataFrame

## Where to Look (API-Side Fix Needed)

Check your `prediction_api.py` or similar API file for:

```python
# BAD - if data is numpy array
data.tail(30)  # This will fail

# GOOD - ensure data is DataFrame
if isinstance(data, np.ndarray):
    data = pd.DataFrame(data)
data.tail(30)
```

Common locations where this might occur:
1. **Feature engineering step** - After `feature_engineer.engineer_features()`
2. **Data fetching** - After `fetch_live_data()` or similar
3. **Preprocessing** - Before creating sequences

## Likely Fix in Your API Code

Find the line that does something like:
```python
recent_data = data.tail(sequence_length)  # or similar
```

And ensure `data` is a DataFrame:
```python
# Add this check before .tail()
if isinstance(data, np.ndarray):
    data = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=feature_columns)

recent_data = data.tail(sequence_length)
```

## Frontend Handling (Already Implemented)

The Streamlit app now:
- ✅ Shows detailed error messages
- ✅ Provides troubleshooting information
- ✅ Includes contact information for support
- ✅ Has debug mode to test API endpoints

## Next Steps

1. **Update your API code** to fix the numpy/DataFrame issue
2. **Redeploy the API** to Render
3. **Test** the prediction endpoint
4. **Remove debug expander** from Streamlit app once confirmed working
